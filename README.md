Interval-Scheduling-using-Greedy-Algorithm
==========================================

Interval Scheduling using Greedy Algorithm
The input to your algorithm should be a file. Note
that the values are space separated. Each line gives a job name and the start
and fnish time of that job.

Example:
a 0 6
b 1 4
c 3 5
d 3 8
e 4 7
f 5 9
g 6 10
e 8 11
